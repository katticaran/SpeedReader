The tests indicated that the participants were unable to comprehend information at higher speeds. Both participants managed to get atleast 2/3 right answers for the first few tries (at speeds below 350wpm). However, on further increasing the speeds the participants were unable to answer more than 1 question. This is in contrast to the level of comprehension gained without the speedReader. i.e. both participants were able to answer all questions correctly when the speedReader was not used. The data therefore indicates that the speedReader reduces the level of comprehension of the individual reading the text.
